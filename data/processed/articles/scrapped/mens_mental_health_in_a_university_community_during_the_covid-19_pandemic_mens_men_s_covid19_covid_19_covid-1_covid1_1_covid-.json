In contexts marked by social inequalities, the pandemic exposes processes of marginalization \nand social exclusion, revealing that the groups most affected by this disease are those who were \nalready facing precarious living conditions. This includes Indigenous populations, Black and traditional \npeoples, as well as the poorest and most destitute individuals, the homeless, informal workers, \npeople working in essential services, among others (Farias & Leite Junior, 2021; Garcia et al., 2020). From this perspective, studies have highlighted the need to consider phenomena that go beyond \nthe biomedical dimension, which was strongly emphasized in the early months of the pandemic. They highlight the importance of investigations that consider psychosocial aspects, especially social \ndeterminants such as gender, race, and social class, which have long been identified as significant \nfactors in the process of health, illness, and care (Farias & Leite Junior, 2021; Garcia et al., 2020).",

Given this scenario, what is the explanation for the male distancing from healthcare services \nand practices? Although it is a complex problem, several authors have emphasized the importance \nof considering the representations and meanings attributed to “being a man”, as well as the role of \nmale sociability in understanding this scenario (Betron et al., 2020). Historically, societies have been \nbuilt around male domination (Bourdieu, 2011), through which men, more specifically heterosexual, \nwhite, and financially well-off, are represented as superior to women and to other men, such as Black \nmen, homosexuals, individuals with disabilities, and the poor. This therefore legitimizes symbolic and \ninstitutional violence that ensures their position of power and centrality in society (Bourdieu, 2011).",

        "page_content": "Even today, despite various advances and sociocultural changes, values such as strength, \ncourage, and bravery are still attributed to men, which must be proven through behaviors that \nexpose them to risky situations, thus demonstrating their virility in comparison to other members \nof the social group (Bourdieu, 2011; Miranda et al., 2018). According to Connell and Messerschmidt \n(2013), these beliefs and behaviors are related to the model of hegemonic masculinity, which, \naccording to the author, refers to an idealized pattern of practices developed and upheld by men \ndaily, as well as a diversity of social expectations that determine what is expected of a “real man”, \nto the detriment of other ways of experiencing masculinities (Connell & Messerschmidt, 2013). In \neach context, a variety of prescriptions, norms, and beliefs coexist that not only dominate but also \nshape ideas about what it truly means to be a masculine and virile man, reflecting in men’s ways of \nthinking, feeling, and acting on their own masculinity in their daily lives (Alcadipani, 2020; Connell \n& Messerschmidt, 2013).",

A study conducted with 45,161 Brazilians (46.4% \nmales) showed that age group was a variable associated with feelings of sadness and depression, \nanxiety and nervousness, and sleep problems. A higher frequency of these outcomes was observed \namong those aged 18 to 29 years compared to those aged 30 to 59 years and 60 years or older (G. \nM. M. Barros et al., 2021). Age group was also associated with the feeling of social isolation, which may indicate the \nrelation between the habits of individuals in the university community according to their age group, \ninfluenced by the frequency of social interaction. Among university students, the vulnerability to \nthe occurrence of mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable and is mainly \nrelated to a lack of social interaction (G. M. M.

Regarding occupation, it is observed that being a student puts the individual in a vulnerable \nsituation for the occurrence of mental disorders due to various uncertainties and concerns that arose \nduring the pandemic, particularly related to academic activities (Rodriguez-Rey et al., 2020). Aspects \nrelated to work routine and schedules, once destabilized, could have repercussions on mental health \nand habits during the pandemic for individuals who work or work and study (Kazmi et al., 2020). The relation found between occupation and financial difficulties may be related to the economic \nimpacts of the pandemic on the population (Rodriguez-Rey et al., 2020).
