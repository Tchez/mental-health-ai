The Self-Reporting Questionnaire SRQ-20 measured common mental disorders CMD, the outcome variable. The interaction measures were verified based on the additivity criterion by calculating the excess prevalence, excess prevalence ratio, and relative difference.

The primary exposure variables were gender, race, and occupational stressors, assessed using the Effort-Reward Imbalance ERI scale. The Self-Reporting Questionnaire SRQ-20 measured common mental disorders CMD, the outcome variable. The interaction measures were verified based on the additivity criterion by calculating the excess prevalence, excess prevalence ratio, and relative difference. Results: 3,343 workers participated, 77.9 were female. CMD prevalence was 21.7 higher among women, Black people, and those exposed to work stressors. Among Black women in a situation of ERI, the prevalence of CMD was three times higher compared with white men in a situation of balance reference group. Discussion: black women workers accumulate social disadvantages and are more susceptible to occupations that require more significant effort and less reward.

Methods: cross-sectional study with a random sample of health workers in Bahia, Brazil. The primary exposure variables were gender, race, and occupational stressors, assessed using the Effort-Reward Imbalance ERI scale. The Self-Reporting Questionnaire SRQ-20 measured common mental disorders CMD, the outcome variable. The interaction measures were verified based on the additivity criterion by calculating the excess prevalence, excess prevalence ratio, and relative difference. Results: 3,343 workers participated, 77.9 were female. CMD prevalence was 21.7 higher among women, Black people, and those exposed to work stressors. Among Black women in a situation of ERI, the prevalence of CMD was three times higher compared with white men in a situation of balance reference group. Discussion: black women workers accumulate social disadvantages and are more susceptible to occupations that require more significant effort and less reward.

The primary exposure variables were gender, race, and occupational stressors, assessed using the Effort-Reward Imbalance ERI scale. The Self-Reporting Questionnaire SRQ-20 measured common mental disorders CMD, the outcome variable. The interaction measures were verified based on the additivity criterion by calculating the excess prevalence, excess prevalence ratio, and relative difference. Results: 3,343 workers participated, 77.9 were female. CMD prevalence was 21.7 higher among women, Black people, and those exposed to work stressors. Among Black women in a situation of ERI, the prevalence of CMD was three times higher compared with white men in a situation of balance reference group. Discussion: black women workers accumulate social disadvantages and are more susceptible to occupations that require more significant effort and less reward. CMD prevalence was higher at the intersection of exposures. Combined effect of the factors exceeded the sum of the isolated effects, demonstrating an interaction between gender, race, and occupational stressors.
