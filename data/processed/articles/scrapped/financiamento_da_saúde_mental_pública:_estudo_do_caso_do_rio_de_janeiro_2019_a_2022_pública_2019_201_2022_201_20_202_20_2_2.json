The study of state co-financing of the Psychosocial Care Network in Rio de Janeiro 2019 to 2022 aimed to explain how theoretical-conceptual elements about mental health were relevant in interfederative financing decisions in this period. A review of federal and state regulations of the Intermanagement Committees Bipartite and Tripartite, technical notes and Fala.BR site was carried out. The documents demonstrated the interfederative rupture in relation to territorial and community-based mental health care.

The deinstitutionalization of asylum survivors and the expansion of the care network for crisis situations are results found in Rio de Janeiro. The conclusion of the study suggests the construction of an interfederative monitoring methodology for public mental health financing so that the delivery of care is increasingly closer to the needs of citizens and territorial vulnerabilities. diseasecentered disease centered socioenvironmental socio environmental determinants cofinancing co 2019 201 2022 theoreticalconceptual theoretical conceptual period Bipartite Tripartite, Tripartite , Tripartite FalaBR Fala BR out communitybased community based states s R 17 qualification vulnerabilities 201 20 202 1 20 2 2",
