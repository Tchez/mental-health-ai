            "source_description": "ABSTRACT The return and worsening of hunger during the COVID-19 pandemic were important setbacks experienced by the Brazilian population in recent years, as a result of a necropolitics form of government, which refused to look at and offer public policies aimed at vulnerable populations. The act of eating, in itself, is a promoter of physical and mental health, which has been denied to a large part of the population during the pandemic. This research, based on cartography method, aimed to investigate arrangements of mental health produced in the communities, in Heliópolis, a favela in São Paulo. Among the main findings, we highlight arrangements to expand the food supply, rescue the political importance of individuals residing in the territory, marches denouncing the situation of hunger in the favelas, as well as affective sharing of stories mediated by the sharing of food. These actions show the importance of the act of eating as a promoter of physical and mental health and highlight the importance of the relationships produced and mediated by food. The fight for food and its sharing, in a scenario of political dismantling and return of hunger in the country, presented itself as a form of resistance and collective confrontation to necropolitics.
