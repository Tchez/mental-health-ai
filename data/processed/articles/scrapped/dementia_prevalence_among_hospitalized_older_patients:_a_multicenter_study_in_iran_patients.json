Researchers utilized the Activities of Daily Living-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ADL-IADL scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale GDS, the Mini-Cog test, the 4 As test 4AT, and the Abbreviated Mental Test Score AMTS. Among the 420 recruited older inpatients, 228 54.3 were female. Results: The mean age of participants was 71.39 years standard deviation 7.95, with 30.7 diagnosed with major neurocognitive disorder dementia. The likelihood of dementia exhibited statistically significant correlations with gender, age, number of children, and occupation. Conclusions: Screening older individuals for cognitive impairment upon hospital admission holds the potential to prevent adverse outcomes and enhance the quality of treatment for patients concurrently dealing with dementia. st century diagnosis Objective hospitals Methods   6 cities LivingInstrumental Instrumental ADLIADL ADL IADL ADL-IADL scale GDS, GDS , GDS MiniCog Mini Cog As A s 4AT, 4AT AT 4AT AMTS.

Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of dementia and its associated risk factors among older patients admitted to hospitals. Methods: The study included older patients  60 years admitted to medical departments of a general hospital in three major Iranian cities. Researchers utilized the Activities of Daily Living-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ADL-IADL scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale GDS, the Mini-Cog test, the 4 As test 4AT, and the Abbreviated Mental Test Score AMTS. Among the 420 recruited older inpatients, 228 54.3 were female. Results: The mean age of participants was 71.39 years standard deviation 7.95, with 30.7 diagnosed with major neurocognitive disorder dementia.

Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of dementia and its associated risk factors among older patients admitted to hospitals. Methods: The study included older patients  60 years admitted to medical departments of a general hospital in three major Iranian cities. Researchers utilized the Activities of Daily Living-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living ADL-IADL scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale GDS, the Mini-Cog test, the 4 As test 4AT, and the Abbreviated Mental Test Score AMTS. Among the 420 recruited older inpatients, 228 54.3 were female. Results: The mean age of participants was 71.39 years standard deviation 7.95, with 30.7 diagnosed with major neurocognitive disorder dementia. The likelihood of dementia exhibited statistically significant correlations with gender, age, number of children, and occupation. Conclusions: Screening older individuals for cognitive impairment upon hospital admission holds the potential to prevent adverse outcomes and enhance the quality of treatment for patients concurrently dealing with dementia. st century diagnosis Objective hospitals Methods   6 cities LivingInstrumental Instrumental ADLIADL ADL IADL ADL-IADL scale GDS, GDS , GDS MiniCog Mini Cog As A s 4AT, 4AT AT 4AT AMTS.
