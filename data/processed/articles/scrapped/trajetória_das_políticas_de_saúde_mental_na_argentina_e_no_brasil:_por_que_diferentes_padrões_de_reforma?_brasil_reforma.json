From the 1990s onwards, in the context of \ntransition from authoritarian regimes to democracy in Latin America, mental health \ncare reforms gained momentum (Desviat, 2015; Sosa, 2015). After three decades, it is possible to evaluate that the implementation of mental \nhealth-care alternatives in Latin countries has progressed. The deinstitutionalization \nof the mentally ill is no longer limited only to hospitals but includes the expansion of \nservices capable of having an impact on society and in the social practices surrounding \npsychological suffering (Agrest et al., 2018; Amorim; Dimenstein, 2009; Caldas de \nAlmeida; Horvitz-Lennon, 2010).",

In addition, there are “multiple implementation patterns”  of mental health policies \n(Agrest et al., 2018). To better understand the reasons for the differences between them, this article \nseeks to respond to the scarcity of comparative research on the processes of change \nin the field of mental health care among the countries of the Latin America (Blanco \net al., 2017), offering findings and reflections that can be compared in other studies \n(Gerlero et al., 2010; Heredia; Barcala, 2017).
