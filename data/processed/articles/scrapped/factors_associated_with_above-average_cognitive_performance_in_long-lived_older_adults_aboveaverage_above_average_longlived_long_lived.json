In this context, some studies document that certain groups of individuals above the age of 80 \nexhibit superior mnemonic and overall cognitive performance abilities when compared to cognitively \nhealthy older individuals matched by age or level of education or to younger older adults (Bucci et \nal., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2019). Some of these older individuals achieve high mnemonic \nperformance that surpasses normative values and those expected for adults who are at least two \nto three decades younger (Gefen et al., 2014). Among the factors that moderate or explain the performance differences in this group, \nelevated social participation, strong social support, better physical health, and adoption of a \nhealthy lifestyle are highlighted (Cho et al., 2015; Holstege et al., 2018; Tindale et al., 2019).",

However, it is worth noting that sociodemographic factors can also play a role on the cognitive \ncapacity of long-lived older adults.

It is considered that individuals with lower levels of \neducation and advanced age tend to obtain lower scores in cognitive assessments (Scherrer Júnior \net al., 2019).",

All responses were electronically recorded in a Google form \nand later submitted to the study’s database spreadsheet. Data Analysis\nThe data were quantitatively analyzed using the IBM®SPSS® software, version 20.0. Mean \ncomparisons between groups were performed using non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney \ntest for discrete and continuous quantitative variables, and Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for \ncategorical quantitative variables. Non-parametric tests were chosen due to the lack of normal \ndistribution in discrete and continuous variables. Additionally, the effect size value was calculated \nfor statistically significant associations in group comparison tests.",

This becomes particularly important when designing policies for the promotion and \nprevention of cognitive health, as well as for the planning of actions that can enhance satisfactory \nliving conditions in advanced old age. In this context, the development of more studies with Brazilian \nlong-lived individuals is necessary to verify whether the same variables observed are associated \nwith better cognitive performance in this age group. Conclusion\nIn the present study, high global cognitive performance in advanced old age was associated \nwith perceived health, satisfaction with functional performance, and subjective assessment of \nsocial support.",
