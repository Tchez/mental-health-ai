The testimonies revealed the major impacts of the loss of a family member on the indirect victims health, such as intense mental suffering and the negative impacts on human occupations such as work, leisure, health care, and sleep. Institutional support is limited in the face of the traumatic experience, whereas activist groups and entities tied to human rights advocacy are of great help in overcoming the pain of loss, especially for those who have lost their family members to the police.
