Assessing the well-being of medical students could guide academic policies and future research for improving the mental and physical health status of the population at risk. This study aimed to identify the influence of medical training on the quality of life of Brazilian medical students. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the Cochrane criteria and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol PRISMA. The search was performed by two independent investigators using a predefined protocol registered on the PROSPERO database CRD42021237926. Data were extracted from PubMed, Embase, and Biblioteca Virtual de Saúde BVS. For quantitative synthesis, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the mean difference in the quality of life between medical students at different stages in the academic cycle, stratified by sex. All data were analyzed using the random-effects model, with a confidence interval of 95 95CI. Results After evaluating the eligibility criteria, five studies were included in the meta-analysis. The data revealed that students in the pre-clinical cycle of the course exhibited higher quality of life scores in the physical 3.05 1.48-4.62, p  0.0001 and psychological 3.05 0.80-5.30, p  0.0001 domains than students in the clerkship cycle.

        "page_content": "Introduction\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has defined \nquality of life (QoL) as “the individual’s perception of \ntheir position in life in the context of the culture and \nvalue systems in which they live, and in relation to their \ngoals, expectations, standards, and concerns.”1 It is a broad term that is used to describe an individual’s \nhealth, making this assessment more comprehensive.2,3 \nMany observational studies have been conducted \nworldwide to assess the QoL of medical students using \nvarious indices. These studies showed that future \nphysicians were more likely to have poorer scores on \nQoL, anxiety, and depression indices.4-6",

Assessing the well-being of medical students could guide academic policies and future research for improving the mental and physical health status of the population at risk. This study aimed to identify the influence of medical training on the quality of life of Brazilian medical students. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the Cochrane criteria and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol PRISMA. The search was performed by two independent investigators using a predefined protocol registered on the PROSPERO database CRD42021237926. Data were extracted from PubMed, Embase, and Biblioteca Virtual de Saúde BVS. For quantitative synthesis, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the mean difference in the quality of life between medical students at different stages in the academic cycle, stratified by sex. All data were analyzed using the random-effects model, with a confidence interval of 95 95CI. Results After evaluating the eligibility criteria, five studies were included in the meta-analysis. The data revealed that students in the pre-clinical cycle of the course exhibited higher quality of life scores in the physical 3.05 1.48-4.62, p  0.0001 and psychological 3.05 0.80-5.30, p  0.0001 domains than students in the clerkship cycle.

Assessing the well-being of medical students could guide academic policies and future research for improving the mental and physical health status of the population at risk. This study aimed to identify the influence of medical training on the quality of life of Brazilian medical students. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the Cochrane criteria and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol PRISMA. The search was performed by two independent investigators using a predefined protocol registered on the PROSPERO database CRD42021237926. Data were extracted from PubMed, Embase, and Biblioteca Virtual de Saúde BVS. For quantitative synthesis, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the mean difference in the quality of life between medical students at different stages in the academic cycle, stratified by sex. All data were analyzed using the random-effects model, with a confidence interval of 95 95CI. Results After evaluating the eligibility criteria, five studies were included in the meta-analysis. The data revealed that students in the pre-clinical cycle of the course exhibited higher quality of life scores in the physical 3.05 1.48-4.62, p  0.0001 and psychological 3.05 0.80-5.30, p  0.0001 domains than students in the clerkship cycle.

For quantitative synthesis, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the mean difference in the quality of life between medical students at different stages in the academic cycle, stratified by sex. All data were analyzed using the random-effects model, with a confidence interval of 95 95CI. Results After evaluating the eligibility criteria, five studies were included in the meta-analysis. The data revealed that students in the pre-clinical cycle of the course exhibited higher quality of life scores in the physical 3.05 1.48-4.62, p  0.0001 and psychological 3.05 0.80-5.30, p  0.0001 domains than students in the clerkship cycle.

Conclusion Our analysis revealed that the medical course is associated with decreased quality of life of medical students in the physical and psychological domains. This finding was observed in both men and women. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution given the study limitations.

Assessing the well-being of medical students could guide academic policies and future research for improving the mental and physical health status of the population at risk. This study aimed to identify the influence of medical training on the quality of life of Brazilian medical students. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the Cochrane criteria and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol PRISMA. The search was performed by two independent investigators using a predefined protocol registered on the PROSPERO database CRD42021237926.

For quantitative synthesis, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the mean difference in the quality of life between medical students at different stages in the academic cycle, stratified by sex. All data were analyzed using the random-effects model, with a confidence interval of 95 95CI. Results After evaluating the eligibility criteria, five studies were included in the meta-analysis.

Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the Cochrane criteria and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol PRISMA. The search was performed by two independent investigators using a predefined protocol registered on the PROSPERO database CRD42021237926.

For quantitative synthesis, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the mean difference in the quality of life between medical students at different stages in the academic cycle, stratified by sex. All data were analyzed using the random-effects model, with a confidence interval of 95 95CI. Results After evaluating the eligibility criteria, five studies were included in the meta-analysis.
