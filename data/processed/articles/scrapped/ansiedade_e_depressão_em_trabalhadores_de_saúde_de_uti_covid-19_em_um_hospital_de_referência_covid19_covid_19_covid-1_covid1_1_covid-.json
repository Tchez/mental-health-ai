A descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted with 140 ICU workers from the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital, including physicians, nurses, and nursing technicians. The workers completed a sociodemographic and occupational questionnaire, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 GAD-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 PHQ-9. The prevalence of anxiety was 38.6, with a higher rate among nursing technicians 42.2. The prevalence of depression was 41.4, with a higher rate among physicians 46.4. Younger workers or those who lacked leisure time had a higher rate of anxiety and depression. An association was also found between working both day and night shifts and the presence of depressive symptoms.

A descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted with 140 ICU workers from the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital, including physicians, nurses, and nursing technicians. The workers completed a sociodemographic and occupational questionnaire, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 GAD-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 PHQ-9. The prevalence of anxiety was 38.6, with a higher rate among nursing technicians 42.2. The prevalence of depression was 41.4, with a higher rate among physicians 46.4. Younger workers or those who lacked leisure time had a higher rate of anxiety and depression. An association was also found between working both day and night shifts and the presence of depressive symptoms.

A descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted with 140 ICU workers from the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital, including physicians, nurses, and nursing technicians. The workers completed a sociodemographic and occupational questionnaire, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 GAD-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 PHQ-9. The prevalence of anxiety was 38.6, with a higher rate among nursing technicians 42.2. The prevalence of depression was 41.4, with a higher rate among physicians 46.4. Younger workers or those who lacked leisure time had a higher rate of anxiety and depression. An association was also found between working both day and night shifts and the presence of depressive symptoms.

A descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted with 140 ICU workers from the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital, including physicians, nurses, and nursing technicians. The workers completed a sociodemographic and occupational questionnaire, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 GAD-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 PHQ-9. The prevalence of anxiety was 38.6, with a higher rate among nursing technicians 42.2. The prevalence of depression was 41.4, with a higher rate among physicians 46.4. Younger workers or those who lacked leisure time had a higher rate of anxiety and depression. An association was also found between working both day and night shifts and the presence of depressive symptoms.

A descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted with 140 ICU workers from the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital, including physicians, nurses, and nursing technicians. The workers completed a sociodemographic and occupational questionnaire, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 GAD-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 PHQ-9. The prevalence of anxiety was 38.6, with a higher rate among nursing technicians 42.2. The prevalence of depression was 41.4, with a higher rate among physicians 46.4. Younger workers or those who lacked leisure time had a higher rate of anxiety and depression. An association was also found between working both day and night shifts and the presence of depressive symptoms.

A descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted with 140 ICU workers from the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital, including physicians, nurses, and nursing technicians. The workers completed a sociodemographic and occupational questionnaire, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 GAD-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 PHQ-9. The prevalence of anxiety was 38.6, with a higher rate among nursing technicians 42.2. The prevalence of depression was 41.4, with a higher rate among physicians 46.4. Younger workers or those who lacked leisure time had a higher rate of anxiety and depression. An association was also found between working both day and night shifts and the presence of depressive symptoms. It is concluded that ICU healthcare professionals are experiencing distress due to intensified work caused by the pandemic, highlighting the importance of mental health prevention and care policies.

A descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted with 140 ICU workers from the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital, including physicians, nurses, and nursing technicians. The workers completed a sociodemographic and occupational questionnaire, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 GAD-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 PHQ-9. The prevalence of anxiety was 38.6, with a higher rate among nursing technicians 42.2. The prevalence of depression was 41.4, with a higher rate among physicians 46.4. Younger workers or those who lacked leisure time had a higher rate of anxiety and depression. An association was also found between working both day and night shifts and the presence of depressive symptoms. It is concluded that ICU healthcare professionals are experiencing distress due to intensified work caused by the pandemic, highlighting the importance of mental health prevention and care policies.

            "source_description": "ABSTRACT This study aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression among Intensive Care Unit ICU workers providing care to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in a referral hospital in Pernambuco, Brazil. A descriptive, quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted with 140 ICU workers from the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital, including physicians, nurses, and nursing technicians. The workers completed a sociodemographic and occupational questionnaire, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 GAD-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 PHQ-9. The prevalence of anxiety was 38.6, with a higher rate among nursing technicians 42.2. The prevalence of depression was 41.4, with a higher rate among physicians 46.4. Younger workers or those who lacked leisure time had a higher rate of anxiety and depression. An association was also found between working both day and night shifts and the presence of depressive symptoms. It is concluded that ICU healthcare professionals are experiencing distress due to intensified work caused by the pandemic, highlighting the importance of mental health prevention and care policies.
