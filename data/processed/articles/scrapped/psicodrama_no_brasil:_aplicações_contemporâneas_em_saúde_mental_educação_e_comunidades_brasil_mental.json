In a country that has birthed to the world influential figures in both the social \nsciences and dramatic arts, such as Paulo Freire and Augusto Boal, the cultural and socio-historical soil of Brazil embraces \nthe creative revolution proposed by Jacob Levy Moreno, and here his theory finds fertile ground flourishing with the \ncreativity and spontaneity of a people who derive strength and resilience from collective bonds and their ancestral roots. Naturally, such a revolutionary approach emerges not merely as a psychological technique, but as a dynamic force, a \ntransformative tool weaving through the fields of art, pedagogy, psychotherapy, politics, and psychosocial dynamics.",

As we navigate through the chapters of this extensive work, crafted by over \n40 authors from diverse perspectives, we unravel the distinctive threads of psychodrama’s evolution in Brazil. We witness \nits emergence as a powerful catalyst for societal transformation, addressing contemporary challenges in the Brazilian \ncontext focusing on resistance, inventiveness, and social transformation (chapter 1). The first act is an invitation to understand the roots of psychodrama in Brazil.",

        "page_content": "In addition, another interesting move from the section is to \ndelve into the minimalist aspect of the modality, probably the most reduced and simplified way of applying the Morenian \ntheory, in individual psychotherapy, named relational psychodrama, by Fonseca, in chapter 10. The reader gains insights \ninto how this simplification can be also useful in fitting psychodrama into a rentable clinical way of psychotherapy, the \nwell-known 50-minute individual session, without giving up psychodrama theory. Heading to the third act, the reader finds a breathtaking compilation of sociotherapeutical applications of psychodrama \nwith vulnerable–or turned vulnerable–populations. Keeping an eye on the processes of social exclusion, the raw social \ncontext in Brazil is marked by colonial practices resulting in greater oppression of specific social groups, generating, and \nreproducing violence. Responding to the same reality, the third section brings examples of psycho-social interventions \nusing psychodrama in a transformative way of dealing with it, when addressing interventions against sexual violence in \nchapter 15, followed by a chapter by Conceição and Penso, approaching psychodramatical interventions with children and \nadolescents under the justice system protection.",

The chapter on psychodrama with the homeless population brought \nimportant reflections on how the partnership between psychology and social work professionals can use sociodrama to \nstrengthen public policies of social justice, to protect the rights of every citizen, especially the most vulnerable ones in the \nurban environment, and bringing necessary reflections on the application of sociodramas in action research methods in \npsychology and social work. Following in Hardler et al. (chapter 18), the reader explores entanglements in philosophical \napproaches, stemming from the Morenian theory connecting with the indigenous renowned author Ailton Krenak and the \ndialogical approach of Paulo Freire’s pedagogies, favoring multiple perspectives of knowledge and transformation, applied \nin the stage of popular health education with indigenous people in the public health system.",

Therefore, the final act addresses psychodrama and politics (chapter 19), ethnic psychodrama (chapter 20), \nan Afrocentric approach focusing on an anti-racist application of psychodrama, public sociodrama against homophobia \n(chapter 21), experiences of using psychodrama as a pedagogical strategy to implement public policies in health and in \neducation (chapter 22), among other practices. In the final section, a highlight must be given to the chapter by Malaquias et al. approaching Morenian ethnodrama \nand African psychology, intertwining ethnic-racial relationships and the future of psychodrama. Then, it is important to \nremember that the deep roots of ethnic-racial issues date from its first sociodrama taking stage in Brazil, with the Black \nsociologist Guerreiro Ramos approaching the Black movement in the late 1940s.",
