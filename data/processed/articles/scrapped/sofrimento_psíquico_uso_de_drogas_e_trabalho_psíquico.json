Its conceptual and practical interfaces are associated with socioeconomic factors; unemployment; psychological \nviolence; the flexibilization and precarization of working conditions; organizational factors; gender aspects; and political, \nsocioeconomic, and sociocultural contexts9. Such understanding recognizes psychological suffering or expressions of \npersonality as social phenomena stemming from historical and social activities in the productive process10. The concern with psychological suffering at work configures a theme that permeates various Brazilian \ntheorists from the 1970s onward, especially those engaged in constructing a non-reductionist social psychology of \nwork in opposition to the prevailing psychology up to then, which followed a functionalist and industrial bias7.

The proposal of the social psychology of work now seeks to consolidate the centrality of the work category in \npsychological practices and the production of approaches and fields of action and intervention considering its historical \nsecondary position. The self-criticism within psychology — especially in work-related mental health — states that the \nwork category is often perceived as peripherical, underestimating (or even ignoring) the importance of work11. The field \nquestions how psychology operated within organizations by disregarding work-related psychological suffering.

Subsequently, psychodynamics of work, after the studies of Christophe Dejours, advances the understanding \nproposed by Le Guillant regarding the difference between work conditions and organization. Psychodynamics of work \nclaim that the impact of work conditions affects the body, whereas the organization of work resonates with the psyche, \ndividing body and mind. When these spheres of work are affected, the physical-psychic capacity overflows, in which no \nforms of regulation and defensive strategies can maintain normalcy — a state in which individuals ensure a precarious \nbalance resulting from the struggle between suffering-defenses-pleasure, which can jeopardize individuals’ health16.",

Furthermore, a study conducted with Brazilian public servants on their abusive use of alcohol using the ergo -\nnomics in the workplace for a better quality of work life approach (which is part of labor health) found an association \nbetween management and work organization elements and the abusive use of alcohol to cope with work-related \ndemands.

Suffering is experienced in the private space, in the \nsubjective intimacy of each individual, when it becomes unbearable. Additionally, it is worth noting that this state of \npsychological discomfort at work and/or situations of unemployment and underemployment can lead workers to seek \nrelief by the use of licit or illicit substances (whether medical, religious, pharmacological, or by other means) in the \nquest to reintegrate pleasure as a way to cope with suffering and achieve therapeutic effects for physical or psycho -\nlogical pain, even if it may lead to abuse and, consequently, dependence. This exacerbation of suffering at work, \nfor example, increases the prescription and use of antidepressants and anxiolytics in companies20. Furthermore, studies conducted in Latin America have found evidence that socioeconomic factors, high \nunemployment rates, lack of access to education, and basic living conditions are associated with increased drug \nuse in the population21.",

Under these conditions, it is no longer possible to ignore \nthat the discomfort and suffering of workers also arise from economic and social determinants, which contribute to \ncountless attacks on life and human dignity that work itself can promote21. Thus, this essay proposes to articulate approaches that gather an adequate theoretical-conceptual framework \nto evaluate the complex and multifactorial issues, such as the relation between psychological suffering and work, with \nalcohol and other drug use as its main element. It also reports the scientific evidence on work situations considering \nindividuals, work, and the environment.

The challenge for both research and public policies aimed at preventing the misuse of alcohol and other drugs \nin the workplace refers to considering their use as a strategy that helps workers to intensify their productivity, resist \nthe effects of fatigue, fulfill their working hours (or overtime), and withstand pressures in organizations. It should be \nnoted that the frequent use of this functional strategy becomes adaptive, resulting in problems and harm to oneself \nand others. Additionally, this behavior seriously affects professional performance, which becomes dysfunctional \nand unhealthy33. In this context, we reinforce the criticism of how public policies toward preventing harmful alcohol and drug \nuse in the workplace have been conducted.",

Objective: to articulate approaches that gather a theoretical-conceptual set that adequately addresses complex and multi-causal topics, such as the relation between psychological distress and work, with the use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs as their main element. Results: scientific evidence points out to the relation between neoliberal labor market changes, moral and ethical violence in the professional environment and negative effects on workers physical and mental health. Studies argue about the need to break with the logic of subjectivist functionalism on the topic of work-related use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs. Conclusion: political strategies aimed at psychological suffering resulting from the useabuse of alcohol and other drugs must go beyond practices solely focused on abstinence and include the interface between integrative theoretical contributions and harm reduction while considering the interaction between suffering and subjects defenses, work and environment.
