T o this end, it considers the dynamic processes in their social, cultural, \neconomic, ethnic/racial, psychological, and behavioral dimensions, which influence the occurrence \nof health problems and their risk factors in the population (Garbois et al., 2017). In line with the logic of the social production of health, in the Constitution of Brazil, it is \nunderstood that health is “resulting from the conditions of food, housing, educational level, income, \nenvironment, work and transportation, employment and leisure, freedom, possession of land, and \naccess to health services” (Ministério da Saúde, 1986, p. 4). That is, health should never be reduced \nto an exclusively biological understanding or justified only by personal behaviors and lifestyles. In the context of a pandemic, the SDH reflects that the risk or effectiveness of contagion by \nCOVID-19 cannot be explained only by the desire or decision of individuals to adhere to prevention \nguidelines, such as the adoption of hygiene etiquette rules and maintenance of social distancing.",

Method An online survey was carried out, with a non-probabilistic sample of 1.397 Brazilians, who answered a biodemographic and general health questionnaire, analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics.

        "page_content": "It is also confirmed that, although COVID-19 and its effects on mental health are susceptible \nto everyone, in countries like Brazil, with greater social injustice, population inequalities, and, \nconsequently, health inequities, there are groups with greater vulnerability and risk (Ruprecht et \nal., 2021), due to different social determinants of health (Buss & Pelegrini Filho, 2007; Garbois et al., \n2017). These groups are affected by different dynamic processes, in their social, cultural, economic, \nethnic/racial, psychological, and behavioral dimensions, which influence the occurrence of mental \nhealth problems (Dimenstein et al., 2017; Garbois et al., 2017). It can be inferred that belonging to minority social groups (women and with diverse sexual \norientation), having more perverse social and economic conditions (poor, with lower income, and \nwithout a stable employment relationship), less coping resources and social support (no religion \nand single) and having factors related to greater risk in the pandemic context (greater isolation, \nhistory of mental health illnesses and COVID-19, and bereaved by the loss of a loved one due to \nthe pandemic) are related to greater vulnerability.",

Faced with this problem, this study aimed to analyze the predictor variables of mental health in Brazilians during the pandemic, identifying the most vulnerable groups. Method An online survey was carried out, with a non-probabilistic sample of 1.397 Brazilians, who answered a biodemographic and general health questionnaire, analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics. Results It was identified that being female, non-heterosexual, unemployed, with low income, and history of mental health comorbidities are predictors of mental health problems. In addition to these, the sample comparisons revealed other groups with greater susceptibility: single and divorced, without religion, with history of COVID-19, maintaining social distancing, and bereaved.
