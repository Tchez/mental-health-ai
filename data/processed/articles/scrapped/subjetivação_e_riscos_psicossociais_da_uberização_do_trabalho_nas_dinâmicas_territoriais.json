This essay aims to reflect critically on new subjectivations and on psychosocial risks related to the uberization of work, analyzing their impacts on territorial dynamics. We highlight platform companies that offer taxi and delivery services, and we provide a panorama that shifts from the international to the national scenario. Uberized workers face unique episodes of violence committed by platform companies and urban violence, which intensify psychosocial risks and harm workers dignity, health, and quality of life. The practices of platform companies, as well as their management and contradictions, reveal a deprivation of the right to the city and the capture of workers subjectivity. economic political territory level dynamics services scenario dignity health life contradictions subjectivity",
