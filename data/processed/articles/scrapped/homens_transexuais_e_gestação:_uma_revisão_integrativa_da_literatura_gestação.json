This integrative review sought to understand the current evidence on pregnancy in transsexual men in the context of sexual and reproductive health care. From a search of the BVS, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Capes, SciELO and PEPSIC databases, from 2010 to 2020, a sample of 11 articles was selected, treated by content analysis and grouped into four analytical categories: health services - positive experiences; cis heteronormative health services; implications of pregnancy for transsexual bodies; and repercussions of gender-affirming therapy and pregnancy. A cis heteronormative logic was found to predominate in health care, leading to negative experiences during antenatal care and childbirth among transsexual men.
