Results Medians and interquartile ranges IR were: 1 ASRS: 26.00 IR: 18 to 38 among PWE versus 17.00 IR: 11 to 24 among controls, p 0.001; 2 HADS: 14.00 IR: 8 to 21 among PWE versus 11.00 IR: 8 to 16 among controls, p 0.007; 3 AEP: 3800 IR: 31 to 49 among PWE versus 33.00 IR: 23 to 43 among controls, p 0.001.

Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity ADHD is also more frequent among PWE, though that condition has been scarcely studied among the adult PWE population. Objective This study aimed to compare the presence of ADHD symptoms between adult PWE and the general population. Methods This was an observational case-control study. Ninety-five adult PWE from a tertiary center in southern Brazil were compared with 100 healthy controls. All subjects were submitted to three structured scales: 1 the World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale version 1.1 ASRS; 2 the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HADS; and 3 the Adverse Events Profile AEP. Dichotomic variables were analyzed through chi-square test and Fishers exact test, as appropriate, and non-parametric variables were analyzed through the Mann-Whitney U test. Results Medians and interquartile ranges IR were: 1 ASRS: 26.00 IR: 18 to 38 among PWE versus 17.00 IR: 11 to 24 among controls, p 0.001; 2 HADS: 14.00 IR: 8 to 21 among PWE versus 11.00 IR: 8 to 16 among controls, p 0.007; 3 AEP: 3800 IR: 31 to 49 among PWE versus 33.00 IR: 23 to 43 among controls, p 0.001. Conclusion PWE showed a higher burden of symptoms of ADHD, depression, and anxiety when compared with controls, which replicates in the Brazilian population the findings of current literature that point toward a higher prevalence of such disorders among PWE.
