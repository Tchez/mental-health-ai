The COVID-19 pandemic represented a scenario of social stress, in which there was a reduction in care for chronic non-communicable diseases, including cases of chronic pain. The aim of this study was to understand the impacts of the pandemic on this population, considering the perception of pain, experience with care and mental health. METHODS: This is an exploratory case study using a qualitative methodology. An intentional sample of six patients diagnosed with chronic musculoskeletal pain, of both genders and aged between 30 and 70 was used. The individuals underwent a semi-structured interview, in which the data was analyzed by thematic analysis and coding. RESULTS: After the analysis, three themes emerged: 1 Multidimensional impact of pain and coping strategies; 2 Characteristics of the health service and individual-centered care; 3 Influence of pain on quality of life and perspective of future life. The impact of health care was a factor of anxiety and uncertainty about pain. It had repercussions on new coping strategies, such as telehealth.

The COVID-19 pandemic represented a scenario of social stress, in which there was a reduction in care for chronic non-communicable diseases, including cases of chronic pain. The aim of this study was to understand the impacts of the pandemic on this population, considering the perception of pain, experience with care and mental health. METHODS: This is an exploratory case study using a qualitative methodology. An intentional sample of six patients diagnosed with chronic musculoskeletal pain, of both genders and aged between 30 and 70 was used. The individuals underwent a semi-structured interview, in which the data was analyzed by thematic analysis and coding. RESULTS: After the analysis, three themes emerged: 1 Multidimensional impact of pain and coping strategies; 2 Characteristics of the health service and individual-centered care; 3 Influence of pain on quality of life and perspective of future life. The impact of health care was a factor of anxiety and uncertainty about pain. It had repercussions on new coping strategies, such as telehealth. In this context, Primary Health Care was a scenario capable of managing the short- and long-term quality of life of individuals with chronic pain.

The aim of this study was to understand the impacts of the pandemic on this population, considering the perception of pain, experience with care and mental health. METHODS: This is an exploratory case study using a qualitative methodology. An intentional sample of six patients diagnosed with chronic musculoskeletal pain, of both genders and aged between 30 and 70 was used. The individuals underwent a semi-structured interview, in which the data was analyzed by thematic analysis and coding. RESULTS: After the analysis, three themes emerged: 1 Multidimensional impact of pain and coping strategies; 2 Characteristics of the health service and individual-centered care; 3 Influence of pain on quality of life and perspective of future life. The impact of health care was a factor of anxiety and uncertainty about pain. It had repercussions on new coping strategies, such as telehealth. In this context, Primary Health Care was a scenario capable of managing the short- and long-term quality of life of individuals with chronic pain.

METHODS: This is an exploratory case study using a qualitative methodology.

The COVID-19 pandemic represented a scenario of social stress, in which there was a reduction in care for chronic non-communicable diseases, including cases of chronic pain. The aim of this study was to understand the impacts of the pandemic on this population, considering the perception of pain, experience with care and mental health. METHODS: This is an exploratory case study using a qualitative methodology. An intentional sample of six patients diagnosed with chronic musculoskeletal pain, of both genders and aged between 30 and 70 was used. The individuals underwent a semi-structured interview, in which the data was analyzed by thematic analysis and coding. RESULTS: After the analysis, three themes emerged: 1 Multidimensional impact of pain and coping strategies; 2 Characteristics of the health service and individual-centered care; 3 Influence of pain on quality of life and perspective of future life. The impact of health care was a factor of anxiety and uncertainty about pain. It had repercussions on new coping strategies, such as telehealth. In this context, Primary Health Care was a scenario capable of managing the short- and long-term quality of life of individuals with chronic pain.

The COVID-19 pandemic represented a scenario of social stress, in which there was a reduction in care for chronic non-communicable diseases, including cases of chronic pain. The aim of this study was to understand the impacts of the pandemic on this population, considering the perception of pain, experience with care and mental health. METHODS: This is an exploratory case study using a qualitative methodology. An intentional sample of six patients diagnosed with chronic musculoskeletal pain, of both genders and aged between 30 and 70 was used. The individuals underwent a semi-structured interview, in which the data was analyzed by thematic analysis and coding. RESULTS: After the analysis, three themes emerged: 1 Multidimensional impact of pain and coping strategies; 2 Characteristics of the health service and individual-centered care; 3 Influence of pain on quality of life and perspective of future life. The impact of health care was a factor of anxiety and uncertainty about pain. It had repercussions on new coping strategies, such as telehealth. In this context, Primary Health Care was a scenario capable of managing the short- and long-term quality of life of individuals with chronic pain. CONCLUSION: This study contributed to understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with chronic pain, which represents a challenge to current care.
