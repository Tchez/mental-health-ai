A population-based study was conducted with 2,166 individuals using data from the ISACamp 201415. The Medical Outcomes Study SF-36-Item Short Form Health Survey SF-36 was used to measure HRQoL according to MD. Prevalence ratios PR were estimated by Poisson regression. Musculoskeletal disorders had a prevalence of 8.5 6.7 tendonitis and 2.7 work-related musculoskeletal disorders - WMSD. Results showed a higher prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in women, active or on leave due to illness, and in individuals with higher education levels. Moreover, reduced HRQoL scores were observed in 6 of the 8 domains, due to MD. The mental component and physical component showed greater impairment respectively among women and men after self-reported WMSD. These findings point to substantial damage from musculoskeletal disorders on the populations HRQoL. WMSD affect the HRQoL of men and women distinctly.
