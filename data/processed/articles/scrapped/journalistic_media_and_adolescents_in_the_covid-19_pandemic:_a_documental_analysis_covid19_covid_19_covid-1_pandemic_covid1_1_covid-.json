Methods: This is a descriptive and qualitative study that used content analysis. Sixty-two journalistic publications were analyzed from a total of 8211 published by the most read newspapers in each Brazilian region between December 2019 and August 2021. Results: The results were grouped and evaluated in three categories: QoL n11, PA n 9 and MH n42. In the analyzed period, the adolescents had more time of exposure to screens, contributing to an inadequate diet, a decrease in PA and impairments in QoL. According to the media publications, the pandemic has also contributed to an increase in anxiety, depression, loneliness and fear resulting from the mental and emotional disorganization caused by the abrupt change in routine. Social vulnerability was presented as an aggravating factor in this context. The journalistic media did not pay the necessary attention to adolescents regarding the negative consequences of the pandemic on QoL, PA and MH. Conclusions: The analyzed reports showed that the pandemic caused a decrease in social interaction, feelings of uncertainty, fear and the appearanceexacerbation of symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression.

The changes observed were an increase in the con-\nsumption of fast and unhealthy foods, a reduction in outdoor \nactivities, reduced peer interaction and sedentary behavior. QoL can be influenced by several factors and is related to \naspects of health, self-esteem, relationships with family, friends, \nschool and work.

Methods: This is a descriptive and qualitative study that used content analysis. Sixty-two journalistic publications were analyzed from a total of 8211 published by the most read newspapers in each Brazilian region between December 2019 and August 2021. Results: The results were grouped and evaluated in three categories: QoL n11, PA n 9 and MH n42. In the analyzed period, the adolescents had more time of exposure to screens, contributing to an inadequate diet, a decrease in PA and impairments in QoL. According to the media publications, the pandemic has also contributed to an increase in anxiety, depression, loneliness and fear resulting from the mental and emotional disorganization caused by the abrupt change in routine. Social vulnerability was presented as an aggravating factor in this context.

In the analyzed period, the adolescents had more time of exposure to screens, contributing to an inadequate diet, a decrease in PA and impairments in QoL. According to the media publications, the pandemic has also contributed to an increase in anxiety, depression, loneliness and fear resulting from the mental and emotional disorganization caused by the abrupt change in routine. Social vulnerability was presented as an aggravating factor in this context. The journalistic media did not pay the necessary attention to adolescents regarding the negative consequences of the pandemic on QoL, PA and MH.

        "page_content": "Among the different reasons for a disconnection from stud-\nies is the fact that many adolescents need to contribute to the \nfamily income and others do not have access to technologi-\ncal resources, which makes it impossible to monitor remote \nclasses.14 In addition to this, millions of students, despite being \nregularly enrolled, did not receive guidance or were not able \nto adapt to carrying out school activities on their own in the \ndistance modality.16 This inequality that underpins Brazilian \nsociety became more evident during the pandemic and the \ninequalities and differences between economic classes became \nprominent in the country to the point where we have a school \ndropout rate of 12% in the adolescent population.3\nAnd it’s not just work that many have had to give up, educa-\ntion is another field of abandonment.",

Methods: This is a descriptive and qualitative study that used content analysis. Sixty-two journalistic publications were analyzed from a total of 8211 published by the most read newspapers in each Brazilian region between December 2019 and August 2021. Results: The results were grouped and evaluated in three categories: QoL n11, PA n 9 and MH n42. In the analyzed period, the adolescents had more time of exposure to screens, contributing to an inadequate diet, a decrease in PA and impairments in QoL. According to the media publications, the pandemic has also contributed to an increase in anxiety, depression, loneliness and fear resulting from the mental and emotional disorganization caused by the abrupt change in routine. Social vulnerability was presented as an aggravating factor in this context. The journalistic media did not pay the necessary attention to adolescents regarding the negative consequences of the pandemic on QoL, PA and MH.

Methods: This is a descriptive and qualitative study that used content analysis. Sixty-two journalistic publications were analyzed from a total of 8211 published by the most read newspapers in each Brazilian region between December 2019 and August 2021. Results: The results were grouped and evaluated in three categories: QoL n11, PA n 9 and MH n42. In the analyzed period, the adolescents had more time of exposure to screens, contributing to an inadequate diet, a decrease in PA and impairments in QoL. According to the media publications, the pandemic has also contributed to an increase in anxiety, depression, loneliness and fear resulting from the mental and emotional disorganization caused by the abrupt change in routine.

Methods: This is a descriptive and qualitative study that used content analysis. Sixty-two journalistic publications were analyzed from a total of 8211 published by the most read newspapers in each Brazilian region between December 2019 and August 2021. Results: The results were grouped and evaluated in three categories: QoL n11, PA n 9 and MH n42. In the analyzed period, the adolescents had more time of exposure to screens, contributing to an inadequate diet, a decrease in PA and impairments in QoL. According to the media publications, the pandemic has also contributed to an increase in anxiety, depression, loneliness and fear resulting from the mental and emotional disorganization caused by the abrupt change in routine. Social vulnerability was presented as an aggravating factor in this context. The journalistic media did not pay the necessary attention to adolescents regarding the negative consequences of the pandemic on QoL, PA and MH. Conclusions: The analyzed reports showed that the pandemic caused a decrease in social interaction, feelings of uncertainty, fear and the appearanceexacerbation of symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression.
