Methods: Data from the Iracema-COVID cohort study interviewed at home mothers who gave birth in the first wave of COVID-19, at 18 and 24 months after birth. Patterns of reported DV were classified as follows: no DV, interrupted DV, started DV and persistent DV. Adjusted multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with persistent DV. Results: DV was reported by 19 and 24 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months postpartum, respectively, a 5 percentage points increase. Persistent DV was present in 11 of the households in the period. The most frequent forms of DV were verbal aggression, reported by 1720 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months, respectively; drunkenness or use of drugs at home, present in 35 of the households; physical aggression, reported by 1.21.6 of the mothers. Households with two or more forms of DV increased from 2 to 12 in the period. Adjusted factors associated with persistent DV were maternal common mental disorder, family headed by the mother and head of familys poor schooling. Food insecurity was associated with starting DV.

Methods: Data from the Iracema-COVID cohort study interviewed at home mothers who gave birth in the first wave of COVID-19, at 18 and 24 months after birth. Patterns of reported DV were classified as follows: no DV, interrupted DV, started DV and persistent DV. Adjusted multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with persistent DV. Results: DV was reported by 19 and 24 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months postpartum, respectively, a 5 percentage points increase. Persistent DV was present in 11 of the households in the period. The most frequent forms of DV were verbal aggression, reported by 1720 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months, respectively; drunkenness or use of drugs at home, present in 35 of the households; physical aggression, reported by 1.21.6 of the mothers. Households with two or more forms of DV increased from 2 to 12 in the period. Adjusted factors associated with persistent DV were maternal common mental disorder, family headed by the mother and head of familys poor schooling. Food insecurity was associated with starting DV.

Methods: Data from the Iracema-COVID cohort study interviewed at home mothers who gave birth in the first wave of COVID-19, at 18 and 24 months after birth. Patterns of reported DV were classified as follows: no DV, interrupted DV, started DV and persistent DV. Adjusted multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with persistent DV. Results: DV was reported by 19 and 24 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months postpartum, respectively, a 5 percentage points increase. Persistent DV was present in 11 of the households in the period. The most frequent forms of DV were verbal aggression, reported by 1720 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months, respectively; drunkenness or use of drugs at home, present in 35 of the households; physical aggression, reported by 1.21.6 of the mothers. Households with two or more forms of DV increased from 2 to 12 in the period. Adjusted factors associated with persistent DV were maternal common mental disorder, family headed by the mother and head of familys poor schooling. Food insecurity was associated with starting DV.

Households with two or more forms of DV increased from 2 to 12 in the period. Adjusted factors associated with persistent DV were maternal common mental disorder, family headed by the mother and head of familys poor schooling. Food insecurity was associated with starting DV. Conclusion: Prevalence of DV was considerably high in the postpartum period.

Methods: Data from the Iracema-COVID cohort study interviewed at home mothers who gave birth in the first wave of COVID-19, at 18 and 24 months after birth. Patterns of reported DV were classified as follows: no DV, interrupted DV, started DV and persistent DV. Adjusted multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with persistent DV. Results: DV was reported by 19 and 24 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months postpartum, respectively, a 5 percentage points increase. Persistent DV was present in 11 of the households in the period. The most frequent forms of DV were verbal aggression, reported by 1720 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months, respectively; drunkenness or use of drugs at home, present in 35 of the households; physical aggression, reported by 1.21.6 of the mothers. Households with two or more forms of DV increased from 2 to 12 in the period. Adjusted factors associated with persistent DV were maternal common mental disorder, family headed by the mother and head of familys poor schooling. Food insecurity was associated with starting DV.

Methods: Data from the Iracema-COVID cohort study interviewed at home mothers who gave birth in the first wave of COVID-19, at 18 and 24 months after birth. Patterns of reported DV were classified as follows: no DV, interrupted DV, started DV and persistent DV. Adjusted multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with persistent DV. Results: DV was reported by 19 and 24 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months postpartum, respectively, a 5 percentage points increase. Persistent DV was present in 11 of the households in the period. The most frequent forms of DV were verbal aggression, reported by 1720 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months, respectively; drunkenness or use of drugs at home, present in 35 of the households; physical aggression, reported by 1.21.6 of the mothers. Households with two or more forms of DV increased from 2 to 12 in the period. Adjusted factors associated with persistent DV were maternal common mental disorder, family headed by the mother and head of familys poor schooling. Food insecurity was associated with starting DV. Conclusion: Prevalence of DV was considerably high in the postpartum period.

Patterns of reported DV were classified as follows: no DV, interrupted DV, started DV and persistent DV. Adjusted multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with persistent DV. Results: DV was reported by 19 and 24 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months postpartum, respectively, a 5 percentage points increase. Persistent DV was present in 11 of the households in the period. The most frequent forms of DV were verbal aggression, reported by 1720 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months, respectively; drunkenness or use of drugs at home, present in 35 of the households; physical aggression, reported by 1.21.6 of the mothers. Households with two or more forms of DV increased from 2 to 12 in the period. Adjusted factors associated with persistent DV were maternal common mental disorder, family headed by the mother and head of familys poor schooling. Food insecurity was associated with starting DV. Conclusion: Prevalence of DV was considerably high in the postpartum period.

Fatores de risco ajustados associados à VD persistente foram: transtorno \nmental comum materno, família chefiada pela mãe e baixa escolaridade do chefe de família. Insegurança alimentar esteve associada \nà VD iniciada. Conclusão: A prevalência de VD foi consideravelmente alta no período pós-parto.",

Methods: Data from the Iracema-COVID cohort study interviewed at home mothers who gave birth in the first wave of COVID-19, at 18 and 24 months after birth. Patterns of reported DV were classified as follows: no DV, interrupted DV, started DV and persistent DV. Adjusted multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess factors associated with persistent DV. Results: DV was reported by 19 and 24 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months postpartum, respectively, a 5 percentage points increase. Persistent DV was present in 11 of the households in the period. The most frequent forms of DV were verbal aggression, reported by 1720 of the mothers at 18 and 24 months, respectively; drunkenness or use of drugs at home, present in 35 of the households; physical aggression, reported by 1.21.6 of the mothers. Households with two or more forms of DV increased from 2 to 12 in the period. Adjusted factors associated with persistent DV were maternal common mental disorder, family headed by the mother and head of familys poor schooling. Food insecurity was associated with starting DV. Conclusion: Prevalence of DV was considerably high in the postpartum period. DV prevention policies should rely on improving care to womens mental health; preventing food insecurity; and fostering the educational level of young people of both sexes.
