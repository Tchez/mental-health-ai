Among the Malaysian urban population, 19.9% presented depression with comorbid \nanxiety (Leong Bin Abdullah et al., 2021). So, some people may be affected by more than one mental \nconditions, as observed by Gorrochategi et al. (2020) in Northern Spain, where a small proportion \nof people experienced co-occurrence of stress, anxiety, and depression. Thus, this study aims to \ndescribe the prevalence of comorbidity in screening for depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as \ndeterminants of comorbidity during the initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Mild-West Brazil.",
