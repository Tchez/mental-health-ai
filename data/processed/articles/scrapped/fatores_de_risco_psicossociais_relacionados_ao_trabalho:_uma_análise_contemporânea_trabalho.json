Authoritarian \nmanagement styles, pressure for results, and performance cults are evidenced by scientific analyses as problems linked \nto the capitalist accumulation2-4 regime and situated in a scenario marked by labor platformization5, deregulation of \nrights, lack of social protection, labor intensification, and unemployment6.

However, formulations of public policies, instruments, and measures \naimed at protecting workers’ health, conceived within the ideological framework of the capitalist accumulation regime \nand neoliberal governmentality, have turned into interventions that, far from transforming work situations, disguise \nthe effects of work-related factors on health, overemphasize actions conducted under individualizing molds, and \nincrease pressures on workers.

In capitalism, \nrelations of production establish specific modes of sociability that permeate all social relations, thus building \na foundation of processes of labor and production organization, as well as of intersubjective and subjective ones.

Health is not merely the absence of \nillness, nor is it merely about adapting to work situations. Following the ergological perspective, health arises from \nactive transformation possibilities, from re-normalizations conducted by workers22, from individual and collective \nconstructions stemming from concrete experiences, and debates on norms and values, never reducible to the law of",

Health begins with the attempt to partially redesign the \nenvironment in which one lives, according to its own norms, elaborated by its history22.

What is \nadvocated here is a conception of health intricately linked to the power to act24 and to the subject’s re-normalizations22.

Objective: this essay demonstrates how the lack of thematic exploration regarding the antagonism and structural conflict between capital and labor, as well as its co-optation by neoliberal managerial logic, impoverishes the debate and weakens initiatives aimed at transforming the work environment. Method: a literature review was conducted using historical materialism as a theoretical framework. Results: policies, instruments, and measures formulated to protect workers health developed under the ideological framework of capitalist accumulation and neoliberal governmentality become understandings and interventions that, far from transforming actual work situations, mask the role played by work in occupational health. They consecrate actions focused on individuals, dampen social struggles, and increase pressure on workers. Conclusion: addressing psychosocial risks should not be limited to mitigating them; rather, it should find its purposes and foundations in a theoretical-practical horizon that unveils the need to overcome the capitalist economy itself.
