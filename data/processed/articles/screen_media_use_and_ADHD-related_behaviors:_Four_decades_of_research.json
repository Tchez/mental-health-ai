        "page_content": "Although some of the hypotheses on the\nmedia –ADHD relationship, such as the scan-and-shift hypothe-\nsis, lend themselves to short-term experimental investigation,\nmost other hypotheses, such as the fast-pace arousal-habituation\nhypothesis and the violence-induced arousal-habituation hy-\npothesis, argue for a longer-term cumulative effect of repeated\nmedia exposure. To investigate these latter hypotheses, longi-\ntudinal studies are needed. Such studies are also needed to in-\nvestigate potential transactional effects. As this review shows,\nalthough transactional effects are likely when it comes to the\nmedia –ADHD relationship, empirical evidence is too scant to\nallow any conclusions on their validity.",

Consequently, it remains unclear as to\nwhether media use is a cause or a consequence of children ’s\nADHD-related behaviors, or both. However, investigating transactional effects is challenging. In\nour experience, the investigation of such effects is complicated\ndue to differences in the state and trait nature of media use and\nADHD-related behaviors. Since ADHD is a trait-like variable\n(4), it is a stable construct with high stability coefficients over\ntime.",

Conversely, media\nuse is a state-like variable, which usually leads to lower stability\ncoefficients, and, as a result, inevitably leaves more variance left\nto be explained by other independent variables. This difference\nin the trait-state nature of concepts in cross-lagged models may\nrender it more difficult to find effects from media use to ADHD-\nlike behavior rather than the other way around. Therefore, as\nargued by Adachi and Willoughby (81), in longitudinal autore-\ngressive models even very small effects should be considered\nmeaningful when there is strong stability in the outcome variable.",
